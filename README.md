### Marco's Github Account

Hi! My name is Marco Gutierrez. I'm a Research Assistant for professors [Michael Best](https://econ.columbia.edu/econpeople/michael-best/) (Columbia University), [Jonas Hjort](https://sites.google.com/site/jonashjort/) (Columbia University) and [Gaston Pierri](https://gastonpierri.com/) (IDB).

Previously, I worked at the [Research Center of the Universidad del Pacifico (CIUP)](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.up.edu.pe%2Fen%2Fresearch-areas-centers%2Fciup%2FPaginas%2Fdefault.aspx&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNH73HZJ2zE67i59Rkj4tM9JZ1oi9g), working on the construction, implementation and management of the Experimental Economics Laboratory of this University ([E2LabUP](https://e2lab.up.edu.pe/)). At the same time, I worked as a Freelance RA for professors [Kevin McCabe](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Feconomics.gmu.edu%2Fpeople%2Fkmccabe&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEuPbdIgo_YUxWv-1Sil04Faadgaw) (GMU), [Louis Putterman](https://www.brown.edu/academics/population-studies/people/person/louis-putterman) (Brown University) and [Kristian Lopez-Vargas](https://kmlv.github.io/) (UCSC).

Here, you'll find my main coding projects, as well as some forks from repos I considered `cool`. Feel free to [contact me](mailto:a20141676@pucp.edu.pe) if you've any question!
