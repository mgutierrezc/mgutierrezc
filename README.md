### Marco's Github Account

Hi! My name is Marco Gutierrez. I am a RA at the [Research Center of the Universidad del Pacifico (CIUP)](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.up.edu.pe%2Fen%2Fresearch-areas-centers%2Fciup%2FPaginas%2Fdefault.aspx&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNH73HZJ2zE67i59Rkj4tM9JZ1oi9g), working on the construction, implementation and management of the Experimental Economics Laboratory of this University ([E2LabUP](https://e2lab.up.edu.pe/)). 

Here, you'll find my main coding projects, as well as some forks from repos I considered `cool`. Feel free to [contact me](mailto:ma.gutierrezch@up.edu.pe)!
